\usage{
fftconv(p)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Accepts a list of probabilities as c(1-p,p)}
}
\value{
The final probability mass function from the convolution
}
\description{
Performs the 'streamlined' approach of convoluting a given probability vector in the Fourier domain,
this function prepares neccessary vectors, including the final result vector, which will be passed
to the a C program to attain the probability mass function.
